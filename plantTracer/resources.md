## VERSION 5.4 

Plant Tracer was built using Laravel version 5.4. All of the basic information I used in learning how to built it can be found here: https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-from-scratch-2017
Laravel is currently on version 5.7, meaning that certain features may be different. For example, foo.dev will now be foo.test when testing a laravel site locally via Laravel Valet. More info on this can be found here https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/valet under the section INSTALLATION.
